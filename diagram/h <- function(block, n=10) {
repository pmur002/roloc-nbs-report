_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Given a two-dimensional polygon, this generates a
     three-dimensional extrusion of the shape by triangulating the
     polygon and creating a cylinder with that shape as the end faces.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     extrude3d(x, y = NULL, thickness = 1, smooth = FALSE, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    x, y: A polygon description in one of the forms supported by
          ‘triangulate’.

thickness: The extrusion will have this thickness.

  smooth: logical; should normals be added so that the edges of the
          extrusion appear smooth?

     ...: Other parameters to pass to ‘tmesh3d’ when constructing the
          mesh.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The extrusion is always constructed with the polygon in the xy
     plane at ‘z = 0’ and another copy at ‘z = thickness’.  Use the
     transformation functions (e.g. ‘rotate3d’) to obtain other
     orientations and placements.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A mesh object containing a triangulation of the polygon for each
     face, and quadrilaterals for the sides.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

     Duncan Murdoch

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     ‘polygon3d’ for a simple polygon, ‘triangulate’ for the
     triangulation, ‘turn3d’ for a solid of rotation.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     x <- c(1:10, 10:1)
     y <- rev(c(rep(c(0, 2), 5), rep(c(1.5, -0.5), 5)))
     plot(x, y, type = "n")
     polygon(x, y)
     open3d()
     shade3d( extrude3d(x, y), col = "red" )
